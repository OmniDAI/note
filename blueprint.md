*   A single-page application structure.
*   `AuthorsNote.jsx` component displaying the author's message.
*   CSS styles for a clean, high-contrast dark theme.

## Development Plan

### Previous Request: Create README.md

**Objective:** Generate a `README.md` file to provide an overview of the project.

**Status:** Completed.

### Current Request: Create Footer Component

**Objective:** Create a footer with social media links and icons that match the existing dark theme.

**Steps:**
1.  **Install `react-icons`:** Add the `react-icons` package to the project to use a comprehensive library of icons.
2.  **Create `Footer.jsx`:** Develop a new component that includes links to social networks (e.g., GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn).
3.  **Create `Footer.css`:** Style the footer to be consistent with the dark theme, ensuring the icons and links are visually appealing.
4.  **Integrate Footer:** Import and render the new `Footer` component in `src/App.jsx`.
